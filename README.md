# oinvogenny

This is a very simple, clean, awesome-looking, open-source, one-click invoice generator application for freelancers & remote job holders to manage payments. All the data are saved on the client's browser. Nothing is saved anywhere so it is secure & safe.

Technical Stack:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## Developing

Once you've cloned this repository and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
or,
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
or,
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
or,
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` or `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
